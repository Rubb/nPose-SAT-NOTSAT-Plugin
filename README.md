# nPose-SAT-NOTSAT-Plugin
Requires:
* nPose V3

When it is desirable to have something happen when an Avatar enters/exits a given seat during the active pose set, this plugin is needed.  If it is not desirable to have this functionality in any pose sets then this plugin is not needed.  These instructions are relative to a seat and not a particular sitter.

Some of the possible uses are listed below to offer an idea of how to use this plugin.  For a deeper explanation on how to implement these instructions go here: https://github.com/nPoseTeam/nPose-V3/wiki/NC-Contents#on_sit
1. Send a message to a sitter in a particular seat.
2. Turn on/off a nPose option.
3. Create a new macro.
4. Rez or de-rez an object
5. Initiate or remove a temp attach of some object.
6. Some instruction that would fire up some other event desired such as a sequencer event, sound event, prim editor event, etc.

Add this plugin to the main build along with the basic nPose scripts when their functionality is needed.
